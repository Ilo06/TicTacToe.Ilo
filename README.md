Tic Tac Toe Game

Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic, two-player game that is simple yet engaging. Played on a 3x3 grid, players take turns marking their spaces with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.

How to Play

1. Start the Game: Two players take turns to play. The first player uses "X", and the second player uses "O".


2. Make a Move: On each turn, players select an empty space on the 3x3 grid to mark their symbol.


3. Win the Game: A player wins by placing three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.


4. Draw: If all the spaces on the grid are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.


5. Game End: After a win or a draw, the game ends. Players can restart the game for another round.
